# Apollo Kotlin Tutorial

This is the tutorial application for working with the [Apollo Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin).

The tutorial is available through our documentation site: [Android Tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/tutorial/00-introduction/).

The current version uses [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for the UI, and is available in the [compose](./compose) directory. In it you can find two folders:
- [initial](./initial): the starter project with the boilerplate and UI code already written but no Apollo Kotlin code.
- [main](./main): the final state of the application with all functionality

In the [views](./views) directory you can find the previous version of the tutorial which has the same functionality, but with the UI written using the Android legacy Views system instead of Compose.

For copy errors in the tutorial, please file bugs against the main [`apollo-kotlin` repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin). For broken code, please file issues on this repo.
